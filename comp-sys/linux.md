## Embedded Linux

Linux kernel is only a small component of an embedded system
based on Linux. In addition to the Linux kernel, you need the
following components to develop, test, and launch your embedded
Linux project:

- A **bootloader** ported and configured for your specific hardware platform
- A **cross-compiler** and associated **toolchain** for your chosen architecture
- A **file system** containing many packages - binary executables and libraries
compiled for your native hardware architecture/processor
- **Device drivers** for any custom devices on your board
- A **device tree** enabled for your particular processor and board

These are the components of an embedded Linux distribution.
