# Asymptotic Analisis 

TODO: Must Have - Big O Notation: Algorithmic complexity, you need to know Big-O.
It's a must. If you struggle with basic Big-O complexity analysis, then you are
almost guaranteed not to get a good job. It's like one chapter in the beginning of
one theory of computation book, so just go read it. You can do it.

## Big-O notation

Algorithm complexity: You need to know Big-O, it's a MUST. In order to understand the running complexity and
memory footprint of the algorithms that you design and implement.

### Linear Runtime 

### Polinomial 

### Logarithmic 

### Square
