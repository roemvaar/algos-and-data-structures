# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.

A C program consists of:

- Functions: Contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done
- Variables: Store values during the computation

You are at the liberty to give functions whatever name you like, but you have to specify
'main' - is a special function - because your program begins executing at the beginning 
of main. Every program must have a main.

Main will usually call other functions to complete its job. One method of communicating 
data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called arguments.

The statements of a function are enclosed in braces {}.

If an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed.
If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however,
the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. Writing
floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral
values emphasizes floating-point nature for human readers.

The choice between *while* and *for* is arbitrary, based on which seems clearer.
The *for* is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and increment
are single statements and logically related, since it is more compact than *while* and
it keeps the loop control statements together in one place.
