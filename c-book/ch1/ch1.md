# Chapter 1 - A Tutorial Introduction

The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.

A C program consists of:

- Functions: Contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done
- Variables: Store values during the computation

You are at the liberty to give functions whatever name you like, but you have to specify
'main' - is a special function - because your program begins executing at the beginning 
of main. Every program must have a main.

Main will usually call other functions to complete its job. One method of communicating 
data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called arguments.

The statements of a function are enclosed in braces {}.
